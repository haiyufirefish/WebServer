### **Lightweight webserver in Linux**
* Concurrency model using thread pool + non-blocking socket + epoll (implemented by ET and LT) + event processing (implemented by Reactor and simulated Proactor)
* Use state machine to parse HTTP request messages, support parsing GET and POST requests
* Access the server database to realize web-side user registration and login functions, and can request server pictures and video files
* Implement synchronous/asynchronous log system to record server running status
* After the Webbench stress test, tens of thousands of concurrent connection data exchange can be achieved

### **Quick Start**
Requirements:
* Ubuntu 16.04+
* MySQL 5.7.29+
* gcc 4.8+

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./server
// in browser
